# Showmoney

Show the currency count HUD element.

## Syntax

````
|showmoney|
````

## Parameters

None.

## Remarks

Specifically, it sets the timer to show it for 10 frames, but this timer only decreases in non [Dialogue mode](../../Dialogue%20mode.md) while as in [Dialogue mode](../../Dialogue%20mode.md), the timer does not decrease. This is based on the message lock being in effect.
