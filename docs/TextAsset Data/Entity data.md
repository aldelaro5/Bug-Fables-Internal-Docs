# Entity data

Entity data are split into 2 TextAssets in the game loaded on boot:

* `Resources/data/EntityValues`
* The `Resources/data/entitydata` directory

## [animid](../Enums%20and%20IDs/AnimIDs.md) data

The TextAsset `Resources/data/EntityValues` from the root of the asset tree contains data that apply to every entities of a given [AnimID](../Enums%20and%20IDs/AnimIDs.md). Each line id of the data corresponds to the matching [AnimID](../Enums%20and%20IDs/AnimIDs.md). The data is loaded on boot during LoadEssentials in the `endata` static field of MainManager. The field is an array of struct of type `Entity_Data`. Specifically, it's done by a method called by LoadEssentials: LoadEntityData:

```cs
public static Entity_Data[] LoadEntityData()
```

NOTE: This asset uses the enum form of the [AnimIDs](../Enums%20and%20IDs/AnimIDs.md), NOT the int form which means the first line represents `None`.

### A word on the asset's format

This format is very unique in the game: it is not encoded in a similar fashion than other TextAssets in the game. Here is how the data is serialiazed:

* The fields are split by `,`
* Every primitives types are encoded as normal (int, float, string, boolean, etc...)
* A `Vector3` is NOT encoded using 3 fields. It is encoded using 1 field with the format `(x, y, z)` where `x`, `y` and `z` are the floats of the vector. Note that the inner separators are expected: the parser will expect the parenthesizes delimiters to know this is parsed differently.
* An empty string is an empty field.

### TextAsset and `Entity_Data` layout

Here is the layout of the data and the fields associated with this struct (NOTE: the position is given according to the TextAsset which means `Vector3` are treated as one position):

|Position|Description|Type|Additional information|
|--------:|-----------|----|----------------------|
|0|shadowsize|float|The default value is 1.0 if the [AnimIDs](../Enums%20and%20IDs/AnimIDs.md) is higher than the max line id contained in the asset|
|1|startscale|Vector3|The default value is Vector3.one if the [AnimIDs](../Enums%20and%20IDs/AnimIDs.md) is higher than the max line id contained in the asset|
|2|bleeppitch|float|The default value is 1.0 if the [AnimIDs](../Enums%20and%20IDs/AnimIDs.md) is higher than the max line id contained in the asset. See [bleep](../SetText/Individual%20commands/Bleep.md) to learn more|
|3|bleepid|int|See [bleep](../SetText/Individual%20commands/Bleep.md) to learn more|
|4|ismodel|bool|See [AddModel](../Entities/EntityControl/Notable%20methods/AddModel.md#addmodel) to learn more|
|5|modelscale|Vector3|See [AddModel](../Entities/EntityControl/Notable%20methods/AddModel.md#addmodel) to learn more|
|6|modeloffset|Vector3|See [AddModel](../Entities/EntityControl/Notable%20methods/AddModel.md#addmodel) to learn more|
|7|freezesize|Vector3||
|8|freezeoffset|Vector3||
|9|freezeflipoffset|Vector3||
|10|preloaddata|string\[\]|The strings are split by `?`, can be left empty in which case, the array is left to `null`. The strings represents asset paths relative from the Asset directory. A `$` prefix means to not preload outside of battle while a `$` indicate it is a sprite instead of a game object from a prefab|
|11|shakeondrop|bool||
|12|diganim|bool||
|13|dontoverridejump|bool||
|14|freezenofall|bool||
|15|noshadow|bool||
|16|walktype|WalkType|Encoded in its int form, see below for the possible values|
|17|basestate|int|This field is loaded, but not used. A value must still be provided or an exception will be thrown.|
|18|basewalk|int|This field is loaded, but not used. A value must still be provided or an exception will be thrown.|
|19|minheight|float||
|20|startheight|float|This field is loaded, but not used. A value must still be provided or an exception will be thrown.|
|21|startbobspd|float||
|22|startbobfreq|float||
|23|hasiceanim|bool||
|24|noflyanim|bool|This field is optional, it can be omitted which leaves a default value of false|
|25|forceshadow|bool|This field is optional, it can be omitted which leaves a default value of false|
|26|Object|bool|This field is optional, it can be omitted which leaves a default value of false|

NOTE: Fields 24, 25 and 26 must be omitted TOGETHER if any are to be omitted. Failure to do so will result in an exception to be thrown when parsing the asset.

### WalkType values
Here are the possible values for a WalkType enum value:

|Value|Name|
|-----:|----|
|0|Normal|
|1|Jump|

The only thing this field does is if it's `Jump`, [Move](../Entities/EntityControl/Notable%20methods/Move.md) will have the entity continuously jump when it can during the movement.

## Map entity data
The `entitydata` directory contains the names and details that applies to each specific entities that should be loaded upon a specific [Map](../Enums%20and%20IDs/Maps.md) load. The data only gets loaded during MapControl's [CreateEntities](../MapControl/Init%20methods/CreateEntities.md) for the concerned [Maps](../Enums%20and%20IDs/Maps.md) which happens on the MapControl's Start. The data ends up in the `entities` field of the MapControl which is an array of EntityControl and each index of that array ends up in the npcdata.`mapid` field of each [NPCControl](../Entities/NPCControl/NPCControl.md). The loaded data ends up in `endata` and it is possible to retrieve the fields later. This is how [CheckSpecialID](../Entities/EntityControl/Notable%20methods/CheckSpecialID.md) reads some of them.

Each line of an entity map asset contains one line per entity. It contains fields about its [EntityControl](../Entities/EntityControl/EntityControl.md) and its [NPCControl](../Entities/NPCControl/NPCControl.md) (via the `npcdata` field) separated by `}`. Each asset corresponds to each map in the game where its asset's filename is the [Map](../Enums%20and%20IDs/Maps.md)'s id.

The names of each entity are not contained in the data assets. They are contained in a `names` directory next to the data assets. An entity name asset contains one string per line that corresponds to the name of entity of the matching line in the matching data asset. The names asset filename is `Xnames` where X is the [Map](../Enums%20and%20IDs/Maps.md) id.

This gives the following layout:

* Path to the entity data files: `Resources/data/entitydata`
* Path to the entity name files: `Resources/data/entitydata/names`

The name of an entity can contain special strings to act as [modifiers](../Entities/EntityControl/Modifiers.md) on it which means the name is both used for debugging purposes as well as to modify its behavior.

### Entity Data File Fields
While a lot of these fields have shared meanings, a lot are dependant of the specifics of the [NPCControl](../Entities/NPCControl/NPCControl.md) (for example, the `data` fields completely changes between them). It is recommended to check the NPCControl documentation to understand where each field is used in what circumstances. The [EntityControl](../Entities/EntityControl/EntityControl.md) fields however tends to remain shared.
