# ExpBag
An UNUSED component that was specifically meant for the `Ressources/prefabs/objects/ExpBag` or `Ressources/prefabs/objects/ExpBagOld` where it would have scaled the GameObject according to instance.`partyexp` / instance.`neededexp`. Since both of these prefabs are UNUSED, the component is also UNUSED.
