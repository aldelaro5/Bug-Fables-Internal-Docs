# DummyControl
An UNUSED component that is never attached to anything.

It has 5 public fields, a FixedUpdate that can change the angles and scale of the GameObject or destroy it according to those fields and a OnTriggerEnter that may destroy the GameObject.

Its original purpose isn't known and its name doesn't indicate it well.
