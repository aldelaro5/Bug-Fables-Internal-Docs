# Pips
A component specifically meant for the `Prefabs/Objects/Pip0` and `Prefabs/Objects/Pip1` prefabs.

They implement the pips dropping logic where they can heal 1 HP or TP each when trigger colliding and they have a limited spawn time. More information on this component can be found in the Death's pips drop logic section.
