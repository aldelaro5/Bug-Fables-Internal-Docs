# CrackRockBreak
A component specific to the `Ressources/prefabs/objects/CrashRockBreak` prefab.

This is setup and configured as part of a [BreakableRock](../../Entities/NPCControl/ObjectTypes/BreakableRock.md) breaking animation where pieces of the rock will go flying in random direction before fading leading to the destructing of the GameObject. Check the BreakableRock documentation to learn more.
