# GroundDetector
A component meant to only be attached to the `Prefabs/GroundDetector` prefab and used programmatically.

This component implements the logic of ground detection that is added by EntityControl to applicable entities. It allows the game to consult if the entity is `onground`.

Check the CreateFeet documentation to learn more on how this prefab is typically instantiated.
