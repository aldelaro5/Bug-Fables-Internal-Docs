# CalculateBaseDamage
This is a method that contains all the damage calculation logic and returns the final amount calculated from the base one given the battle's state. Every damages that goes through the damage pipeline ends up calling this to get the final amount of damage to deal with the exception of the target being invulnerable which are any of the following conditions on the target:

- Its `plating` is true
- It has the [Shield](../Actors%20states/BattleCondition/Shield.md) condition
- It is a player party member with the [Numb](../Actors%20states/BattleCondition/Numb.md) condition and the `ShockTrooper` [medal](../../Enums%20and%20IDs/Medal.md) equipped

There is no other damage calculation logic in the pipeline with the only exception being the clamping done on [DoDamage](DoDamage.md) after getting the final number. Every other logic involves other matters after the damage has been calculated by this method. Alternatively, actions's logic can perform anything outside of this pipeline.

```cs
private int CalculateBaseDamage(MainManager.BattleData? attacker, ref MainManager.BattleData target, int basevalue, bool block, AttackProperty? property, ref bool weaknesshit, ref bool superguarded, DamageOverride[] overrides)
```

## Parameters
All parameters comes directly from [DoDamage](DoDamage.md) (the damageammount becomes the basevalue) with some exceptions:

- `block`: This may be overriden to false by DoDamage If any of the following are true:
    - The target has the [Freeze](../Actors%20states/BattleCondition/Freeze.md) condition
    - The target has the [Sleep](../Actors%20states/BattleCondition/Sleep.md) condition
    - The target has the [Numb](../Actors%20states/BattleCondition/Numb.md) condition
    - The target is a player party member with the `Berserker` [medal](../../Enums%20and%20IDs/Medal.md) equipped
    - This is a non super block while [flags](../../Flags%20arrays/flags.md) 15 and 615 are true (chapter 1 started after the combat tutorial while FRAMEONE is active) and `overridechallengeblock` is false
- ref `weaknesshit`: This is meant to initially contain false, the method will set this to true if a `Magic` or `Flip` weakness was processed
- ref `superguarded`: This is meant to initially contain false, the method will set this to true if the player sucessfully super blocked
- `property`: The [property](AttackProperty.md) of the attack sent by DoDamage (overriden to null is if it was `None` by DoDamage). If this is `Pierce` or `Flip` while the `target` is a player party member, it is overriden to null at the start of this method which invalidates it

## Damage flow
While the attacker is optional (null means no attacker), the target is mandatory. Additionally, the target cannot be part of the same party as the attacker. This means an enemy party member cannot attack another enemy party member and a player party member cannot attack another player party member. This results in the following damage flows available:

- No attacker to player party member
- No attacker to enemy party member
- Player party member to enemy party member
- Enemy party member to player party member

Each have different implications on the calculations. It is assumed that the target is a player party member if it has the `Player` tag. Otherwise, it is assumed to be an enemy party member. If the attacker exists, it is assumed to be the opposite party of the target.

basevalue is the damage amount that will ultimately be returned. This method may modify it for various reasons until it reaches the end where it becomes final.

## Piercing
There is a concept of piercing which ignores all effects related to enemy party members's defense. Despite the concept of defense having multiple calculation errors, piercing correctly and exhaustively ignores all components of defense.

In order for piercing to apply, the following must all be true:

- The target is an enemy party member (this is specifically disabled for player party members)
- The target doesn't have `AntiPierce` in its [weakness](../Actors%20states/Enemy%20features.md#weakness) (only the `Spuder` [enemy](../../Enums%20and%20IDs/Enemies.md) can get it via [CheckEvent](../Battle%20flow/Update.md) when applicable)
- property is `Atleast1pierce` or `Pierce` (the former is the same as the latter, but the final clamp will be from 1 instead of 0 for any cases not counting a `FrostBite` [medal](../../Enums%20and%20IDs/Medal.md) counter)

If the above isn't fufilled, piercing doesn't apply.

## Calculation pipeline table
The calculation pipeline is very complex and most of it will be illustrated by a table.

Each rows of the table contains an effect to basevalue or other additional effects when applicable. Each row contains 3 columns:

- Attack direction: The damage flow denoted in party to party notation. Here's the party defintions:
    - Any: For the attacker, it may or may not exist from either party. For the target, it can belong to either party
    - Attacker: The attacker must exist, but can be in either party
    - Player: The attacker or target must be a player party member
    - Enemy: The attacker or target must be an enemy player member
- Condition: The conditions required for this effect to process. If a list is presented, all conditions must be true unless stated otherwise
- Damage effect: The effects on basevalue if Condition is true. This may contain other effects than changing basevalue. Anything underlined means it's an effect other than increasing or decreasing meaning it's more significant and its position in the calculation is important

These effects are shown in the exact order they appear.

1: This always counts as a super block if `superblockedthisframe` hasn't expired yet. A super block also causes the following to happen:
    
- `superblockedthisframe` is reset to 3.0 frames
- superguarded is set to true
- block is overriden to true

For more information on how super blocks are determined, check [GetBlock](../Battle%20flow/GetBlock.md).

2: This is how ice thawing is done (this is done after the sub effect processed):

- [RemoveCondition](../Actors%20states/Conditions%20methods/RemoveCondition.md) is called with the target to remove the [Freeze](../Actors%20states/BattleCondition/Freeze.md) condition
- [BreakIce](../../Entities/EntityControl/Notable%20methods/Freeze%20handling.md#breakice) is called on the target.battleentity
- target.`cantmove` is set to 0 if the target is an enemy party member or to 1 if it's a player party member. This allows for the actor to immediately be able to act no matter its party (the enemy party doesn't get their actor turns advanced until the next main turn while the player party have theirs advanced right after enemies). NOTE: This logic is incorrect for enemy party members because if they have a [moves](../Actors%20states/Enemy%20features.md#moves) higher than 1, they will loose all but 1 actor turn they should have available. The correct logic is the same than what [AdvanceTurnEntity](../Battle%20flow/AdvanceTurnEntity.md) does which is setting `cantmove` to -`moves` + 1.

3: This means the attack happened to a toppled flying enemy or the enemy wasn't topplable and was hit while flying meaning it should be dropped to the ground. This is how this happens:

- [RemoveCondition](../Actors%20states/Conditions%20methods/RemoveCondition.md) is called with the target to remove its [Topple](../Actors%20states/BattleCondition/Topple.md) condition
- target.battleentity.`bobrange` and `bobspeed` are set to 0.0
- If target.`animid` (the [enemy](../../Enums%20and%20IDs/Enemies.md) id) isn't 208, target.battleentity.`basestate` is set to 0 (`Idle`). NOTE: This [enemy](../../Enums%20and%20IDs/Enemies.md) id doesn't exist, the logic was supposed to check for target.battleentity.[animid](../../Enums%20and%20IDs/AnimIDs.md) for not being 207 (`CursedSkull`) which would have allowed it to to remain in its charge animation even when it falls
- If target.[eventonfall](../Actors%20states/Enemy%20features.md#eventonfall) is above -1 (it's defined):
    - `calleventnext` is set to target.`eventonfall`
    - target.battleentity.`basestate` is set to 11 (`Hurt`)
- Otherwise (target.[eventonfall](../Actors%20states/Enemy%20features.md#eventonfall) isn't defined):
    - target.battleentity.`droproutine` is set to a new [Drop](../../Entities/EntityControl/EntityControl%20Methods.md#drop) call on target.battleentity

4: The `AntlionJaws` [medal](../../Enums%20and%20IDs/Medal.md) was supposed to ignore a defense for each instance equipped. However, there are 5 cases in which this doesn't work correctly:

- The [DefenseDown](../Actors%20states/BattleCondition/DefenseDown.md) condition is ignored
- The defense gained as a result of the [Numb](../Actors%20states/BattleCondition/Numb.md) condition is ignored
- [defenseonhit](../Actors%20states/Enemy%20features.md#defenseonhit-and-isdefending) is ignored on enemies who supports it
- The [DefenseUp](../Actors%20states/BattleCondition/DefenseUp.md) condition is ignored UNLESS target.`def` is 0 where it works correctly. Specifically, this means that if the target's target.`def` is 1 while having the [DefenseUp](../Actors%20states/BattleCondition/DefenseUp.md) condition, at most 1 `AntLionJaws` will count still (even if 2 are equipped)
- The property is `Flip`. This will cause both the medal and the 1 defense ignore to apply independently for the same reasons, effectively ignoring the defense that was already ignored befrehand

5: This is incorrect to do because the [DefenseDown](../Actors%20states/BattleCondition/DefenseDown.md) effect later can still apply which can make it override the numb defense giving +1 erroneous increase to basevalue. For this issue to reproduce, the `DefenseDown` conditions needs to be fufilled while the numb defense conditions also applies which will effectively count 1 less defense than it should. The defense in the HUD reports the correct number, but the calculations are wrong.

Additionally, if the target has all the [DefenseUp](../Actors%20states/BattleCondition/DefenseUp.md), [DefenseDown](../Actors%20states/BattleCondition/DefenseDown.md) and [Numb](../Actors%20states/BattleCondition/Numb.md) conditions, now numb defense won't apply when the other 2 cancel each other resulting in numb defense not being applied when it should have been. This results in the same error.

6: There are 2 ways to look at this because the intent here is unclear:

- Negative defense on the player is allowed due to making it possible via [medals](../../Enums%20and%20IDs/Medal.md) and [DefenseDown](../Actors%20states/BattleCondition/DefenseDown.md) always apply
- Negative defense shouldn't be allowed in general and medals causes a design issue

The second case is a design bug. The first case isn't consistent because the medals exists no matter if HardMode applies or not, but the [DefenseDown](../Actors%20states/BattleCondition/DefenseDown.md) effect may or may not apply.

Additionally, this doesn't take into consideration the numb defense even if its logic was correct (that it would apply regardless of [DefenseDown](../Actors%20states/BattleCondition/DefenseDown.md)'s presence or not). It now means that the numb defense may or may not be cancelled correctly depending on the difficulty which is a bug.

7: `Flip` always ignore at most 1 of target.`def`, but it also ignores unconditionally other types of defenses on top of this incorrectly:

- [Numb](../Actors%20states/BattleCondition/Numb.md) defense
- [DefenseUp](../Actors%20states/BattleCondition/DefenseUp.md) condition
- [defenseonhit](../Actors%20states/Enemy%20features.md#defenseonhit-and-isdefending) on supported enemies when they are `isdefending`

They are also cumulative: if all 3 are combined, they all get ignored on top of the 1 defense ignored from target.`def` while only at most 1 was supposed to be ignored across all defenses.

8: This is the infamous issue known as the "def bug". If target.`def` is EXACTLY 1 (0 or 2+ are accidentally correct) while it has a [DefenseDown](../Actors%20states/BattleCondition/DefenseDown.md) condition, the only defense left will be ignored, but [DefenseDown](../Actors%20states/BattleCondition/DefenseDown.md) will still apply. Only one of the two should apply because there's only 1 defense available to ignore. [DefenseDown](../Actors%20states/BattleCondition/DefenseDown.md) only requires that target.`def` is above 0.

9: These incorrectly refers to the `currentturn` or the `playerdata[currentturn]` when it should actually be the attacker. This distinction only matters in practive when using the [IceBeemerang](../Player%20actions/Skills/IceBeemerang.md) action because it is the only one where the attacker and the `currenturn` may be different while still using the regular damage pipeline as opposed to [GetMultiDamage](GetMultiDamage.md). That being said, this issue could manifest itself in any action where the user isn't the attacker and the damage pipeline is invoked as usual.

The overall effects are that the damage bonuses (with the exception of `PoisonAttacker`) never checks the actual attacker of this damage call. It means whether or not they apply depends entirely on who used the skill on their actor turn. For example, if the user of `IceBeemerang` is `Bee`, but `Moth` is in front, neither will get the front bonus, but if `Moth` was the user, both members (even `Bee`) would get it. Neither scenarios are correct. The `LastAttack` bonuses works the same way.

However, the `PoisonAttacker` bonus case is affected in a much more complex fashion: the check to apply the bonus is correct, but not its application. The actual attacker still needs to have the [Poison](../Actors%20states/BattleCondition/Poison.md) condition for the bonus to apply, but IF it applies, it's by the amount of `playerdata[currentturn]`'s amount of `PoisonAttacker` equipped, NOT the attacker. It means that it would be possible to create scenarios when using `IceBeemerang` that leads to unexpected bonus applications. Here are the possible combinations:

- `IceBeemerang` is used by someone who has `PoisonAttacker`: The bonus applies to both player party members as long as they have [Poison](../Actors%20states/BattleCondition/Poison.md) even if the other member doesn't have any `PoisonAttacker` so if the other member doesn't have any, but they have `Poison`, the bonus is incorrectly applied (and confusingly, this scenario will even allow the bonus to apply on this attacker even if the user of the move doesn't have `Poison`)
- `IceBeemerang` is used by someone who doesn't have `PoisonAttacker`, but the other player party member does: The bonus never applies for either player party member, even for the one that has `PoisonAttacker` and regardless of whether or not this member has [Poison](../Actors%20states/BattleCondition/Poison.md) so it incorrectly doesn't apply

10: This incorrectly excludes [IceBeemerang](../Player%20actions/Skills/IceBeemerang.md) so this action cannot benefit from the `Magic` weakness bonus

11: Due to the `DoublePainReal` clamp effect later, player blocking is effectively ignored or has its impact greatly reduced because the player blocking effect is located BEFORE the clamp instead of AFTER

12: This is incorrect because it means that if the attacker has both the [AttackUp](../Actors%20states/BattleCondition/AttackUp.md) and the [AttackDown](../Actors%20states/BattleCondition/AttackDown.md) conditions, the `AttackDown` one would be incorrectly ignored when it would be expected that both cancels each other resulting in no net changes to the `basevalue`. This is not the case here: the `AttackUp` condition will override the effects of `AttackDown` giving one more damage than it should in most cases

## Status infliction
What happens here depends on the property. These typically attempts to inflict a [condition](../Actors%20states/Conditions.md) on the target when applicable and most of them implies a resistance check.

Here's an explanation of the columns:

- property: The property value the row applies to
- [conditions](../Actors%20states/Conditions.md#conditions) inflicted: The condition to inflict if all the requirements are fufilled
- Requirements: The requirements that must be fufilled for the condition to be inflicted. All statuses requires block to be false and the target to not have the [Sturdy](../Actors%20states/BattleCondition/Sturdy.md) condition. Those checks are implied in this column and won't be mentioned. There is 1 requirement specifically that recurs a lot and will be called with a simplified name:
    - Resistance check: A resistance check must pass for the condition to be inflicted. A resistance is an integer field on the target that can be at most 99 for the condition to possibly inflict. If it's 100 or above, the target is immune and the infliction won't occur. This immunity condition also affects if the `StatusMirror` [medal](../../Enums%20and%20IDs/Medal.md) works. This is how the test occurs:
        - If this is a `chompyaction` or the `playerdata[currentturn]` is a player party member with a `StatusBoost` [medal](../../Enums%20and%20IDs/Medal.md), the resistance used for the test is decreased by 15 (guaranteed to inflict if this subtraction makes the resistance land at 0 or below). NOTE: The `StatusBoost` clause checks the amount equipped on whoever is taking their actor turn, NOT the attacker which can be different if the action used is [IceBeemerang](../Player%20actions/Skills/IceBeemerang.md) and the property is `Freeze`
        - A random number between 0 and 99 is generated and it must be higher or equal than the target's resistance for the test to pass. Intuitively, if the target isn't immune, it means the percentage to inflict is 100 - resistance with `StatusBoost` or a `chompyaction` giving 15% more chances (or a guarantee if the percent number is above 100)
- Resistance increase: After infliction, it's possible the resistance used with the resistance check gets increased. This column indicates if it will happen, under what conditions it will happen and for how much
- `StatusMirror` Infliction scheme: The `StatusMirror` [medal](../../Enums%20and%20IDs/Medal.md) scheme of infliction. This medal only works in an enemy to player attack direction and it requires the resistance used for the resistance check to be below 100 (not being immune). If these conditions are met upon inflictions, the attacker gets inflicted with the same condition. The scheme of the infliction may vary and this column tells how it's inflicted
- Other effects: Anything the infliction does other than inflicting the condition or giving it to the attacker due to `StatusMirror`. Please note that with the exception of the `Sleep` property, [RemoveCondition](../Actors%20states/Conditions%20methods/RemoveCondition.md) is called with the target to remove its [Sleep](../Actors%20states/BattleCondition/Sleep.md) condition if one of the following is true:
    - The target is an enemy party member. NOTE: This contradicts the requirements for [DoDamage](DoDamage.md) to do the same because it does not feature a clause for dealing damages above 0. This means that a an attack that does no damage, but still inflicts can remove [Sleep](../Actors%20states/BattleCondition/Sleep.md) without changing the `cantmove` which is different than if DoDamage removed it.
    - The target is a player party member and it doesn't have a `HeavySleeper` [medal](../../Enums%20and%20IDs/Medal.md)

1: The method does the following to determine if the target can be on fire:

- If the target is a player party member, true is returned unless it has the `ResistAll` [medal](../../Enums%20and%20IDs/Medal.md) equipped and a 50% RNG test is failed where false is returned instead
- If it's a `WaspKing` or `EverlastingKing` [enemy](../../Enums%20and%20IDs/Enemies.md), true is returned if a 30% RNG test succeed, false otherwise
- If it's a `Krawler`, `Cape` or `CursedSkull` [enemy](../../Enums%20and%20IDs/Enemies.md) then it's false if the current [map](../../Enums%20and%20IDs/Maps.md) is any in the `GiantLair` [area](../../Enums%20and%20IDs/librarystuff/Areas.md) other than `GiantLairFridgeInside`. Otherwise, the return is decided with a 50% RNG test
- If it's a `KeyR`, `KeyL` or `Tablet` [enemy](../../Enums%20and%20IDs/Enemies.md), false is returned
- If none of the cases applies, true is returned

2: This is due to the first of those 3 turns ending immediately making it really + 2 turns in practice which matches all other cases where it's always + 2 turns.

## `Flip` handing
Each rows of the table contains an effect to basevalue or other additional effects when applicable. Each row contains 3 columns:

- target's party: The party of the target (any for either)
- Condition: The conditions required for this effect to process. If a list is presented, all conditions must be true unless stated otherwise
- Effects: The effects on basevalue if Condition is true. This may contain other effects than changing basevalue. Anything underlined means it's an effect other than increasing or decreasing meaning it's more significant and its position in the calculation is important

These effects are shown in the exact order they appear.

|target's party|Condition|Effects|

## DefaultDamageCalc
This is a sub method to CalculateBaseDamage which only gets called for most property values (the exceptions being `NoExceptions` where it's never called and `Flip` where it may or may not be called).

It takes the basevalue as ref and despite its name, it only processes optional decreases of the basevalue due to defensive effects.

```cs
private void DefaultDamageCalc(MainManager.BattleData target, ref int basevalue, bool pierce, bool blocked, int def)
```

### Parameters:

- `target`: The target from CalculateBaseDamage
- ref `basevalue`: The basevalue from CalculateBaseDamage
- pierce: Whether defense pierce applies. This value is computed from CalculateBaseDamage, but overriden to false if `target` is a player party member
- `blocked`: UNUSED (this is block from CalculateBaseDamage, but it is never read in the method)
- `def`: target.`def` from CalculateBaseDamage. (NOTE: this is the base value, not the effective one). Overriden to 0 if `pierce` is true while `target` is an enemy party member

### Effects
Each rows of the table contains an effect to basevalue or other additional effects when applicable. Each row contains 3 columns:

- target's party: The party of the target (any for either)
- Condition: The conditions required for this effect to process. If a list is presented, all conditions must be true unless stated otherwise
- Damage effect: The effects on basevalue if Condition is true. This may contain other effects than changing basevalue. Anything underlined means it's an effect other than increasing or decreasing meaning it's more significant and its position in the calculation is important

These effects are shown in the exact order they appear.

|target's party|Condition|Damage effect|
|--------------|---------|-------------|
|Any|target doesn't have the [Flipped](../Actors%20states/BattleCondition/Flipped.md) condition|- def|
|Player|target has the [Poison](../Actors%20states/BattleCondition/Poison.md) condition|- (amount of target's `PoisonDefender` [medals](../../Enums%20and%20IDs/Medal.md) - amount of target's `ReversePoison` medals)|
|Player|target is `playerdata[battle.partypointer[playerdata.lenght - 1]]` (the furthest back in the player party formation)|- amount of target's `BackSupport` [medals](../../Enums%20and%20IDs/Medal.md)|
|Player|target is `playerdata[battle.partypointer[0]]` (the front in the player party formation)|- amount of target's `FrontSupport` [medals](../../Enums%20and%20IDs/Medal.md)|
|Player|target.`hp` is <= 4|- 2 * amount of target's `DefenseUp` [medals](../../Enums%20and%20IDs/Medal.md)|
|Player|<ul><li>target has the [Sleep](../Actors%20states/BattleCondition/Sleep.md) condition</li><li>target has a `HeavySleeper` [medal](../../Enums%20and%20IDs/Medal.md)</li></ul>|<u>Divided by 2 floored</u>|
|Any|<ul><li>target.[isdefending](../Actors%20states/Enemy%20features.md#defenseonhit-and-isdefending) is true</li><li>pierce is false</li></ul>|- target.[defenseonhit](../Actors%20states/Enemy%20features.md#defenseonhit-and-isdefending)|

## Final steps and results
Before the method ends:

- `caninputcooldown` is set to 0.0
- `blockcooldown` is set to 0.0

The final result is determined by the following:

- If a `FrostBite` [medal](../../Enums%20and%20IDs/Medal.md) counter conditions were fufilled:
    - [ShowDamageCounter](../Visual%20rendering/ShowDamageCounter.md) is called with type 0 (damage) with the basevalue (which is now the final amount) as the ammount starting from the world [CenterPos](../Actors%20states/CenterPos.md) of attacker and ending at Vector3.Up. NOTE: this basevalue may be unclamped here which allows to show a negative number
    - The attacker's `hp` is decreased by basevalue clamped from 1 to its `maxhp` (meaning this can't be lethal). NOTE: basevalue may be unclamped here which allows it to be negative and heal the attacker instead of dealing damage to it (the outer clamp is only clamping the final hp, NOT the number by which it is decreased)
    - 0 is returned as the final damage value (this is because the calculations are overriden to deal no damages to the target, but they were dealt manually just now to the attacker)
- Otheriwse, if the attack direction is attacker to player while block is false, basevalue is clamped from 1 to 99
- Otherwise, basevalue is clamped from 0 to 99
